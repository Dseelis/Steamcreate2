The modpack changes names and themes, but your goal remains the same: to find a way to stop the paradoxes.

Old saves may become corrupted.

- Updated core mod
- Updated neoforge 21.1.217
- Mods updated, many removed and replaced
- Complete quest overhaul
- QoL features
- Changes to shaders and resource packs
- Optimization attempts
- Crafting changes
- kubeJs removed, now fully replaced by Steam Core
- New mechanics!

.... and much more. And remember, this is a test build, so a lot can change before the release.
