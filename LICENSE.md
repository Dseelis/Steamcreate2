- Redistribute the **original, unmodified** version of the modpack
- Create videos, streams, and other media content related to the modpack,
  including **monetized content** (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)

---

## 2. Modifications and Redistribution

- Redistribution of **modified versions** of the modpack is **strictly prohibited**
  without explicit approval from the author, even if the changes are minor.

This rule exists to prevent partial changes (e.g. removing several mods)
from being redistributed as a “new” or “alternative” version of the modpack.

---

## 3. Attribution

When redistribution is permitted, you MUST:
- Clearly credit the original author of the modpack

Providing a link to the original source is appreciated,
but not strictly required.

---

## 4. Commercial Use

The following is **NOT allowed** without written permission:
- Selling the modpack or any modified version of it
- Providing paid or restricted access to the modpack
- Using the modpack itself for commercial purposes

**Monetization of videos or streams featuring the modpack  
does NOT count as commercial use of the modpack.**

---

## 5 Server Usage

Running multiplayer servers using this modpack is allowed,
provided that:
- the server is free to access by default
- no direct or indirect commercial gain is involved
- the original author of the modpack is clearly credited
  in the server description, website, or other public page

Monetization of servers (including paid access,
donations required for access, or other monetization methods)
is allowed **ONLY with explicit permission from the author**.

Failure to provide proper attribution or unauthorized monetization
voids this permission.

---

All mods included in this modpack are the property of their
respective authors and are distributed under their own licenses.
